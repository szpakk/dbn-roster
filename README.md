# 53-DBN Roster App

Created for the Cleveland Browns fans community as a platform for making final roster predictions at the conclusion of preseason. Upon official final roster announcement predictions are ranked by how many roster spots were correctly predicted.

**09/22/17**

App is in the early stages of development. You can find it operational at [dbn-roster.herokuapp.com](http://dbn-roster.herokuapp.com). Player database is out-of-date and final roster is not set since the 2017 NFL regular season has already started and therefore the first edition of 53-DBN Roster Challenge is now slated to take place before the 2018 season.

**Installation**

1. Run 'rails db:migrate' and 'rails db:seed' to populate database.
2. In order to give first user admin privilages open rails console and set user's admin attribute to true (temporary solution).
